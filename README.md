# Audio Signal Processing App

> This Is A Simple GUI Application To Manipulate Audio Files By Modifying The Audio Wave Form And Display It Using
> Python

### Requirements

##### Install FFmpeg

* You Need To Install `FFmpeg` From This
  Guide [Install FFmpeg on Windows](<https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows>)

> Make Sure You Install The Python Packages Correctly using `pip install <Pakage Name>`

### Core Features

* Show Audio File Information Such As:
    * File Type (Supports Only `.Wav` Files For Now )
    * Number Of Channels
    * Audio Frame Rate
    * Maximum Audio Amplitude
* Modify The Audio File By:
    * Increasing/Decreasing The Amplitude
    * Increasing/Decreasing Audio Speed
    * Increasing/Decreasing Audio Delay (Shift)
    * Reversing The Audio
    * Add An Echo Effect
* Represent The Audio Wave Form For Both Original And Modified Files
* The Ability To Play Both Audio Files
* Text To Speach Functionality
* Export Both The New Modified Audio File And The Transcript TTS File In A New Directory `Audio output`
* Convolution Operations For Some Elementary Signals
* LTI System Functionality:
    * Convert Between Zeros And Poles Formula To H (s) Represented In Numerator/Denominator Formula
* Support For Stereo Audio Files
* Support Dark Mode Theme
